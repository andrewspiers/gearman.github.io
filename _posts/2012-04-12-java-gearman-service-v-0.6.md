   better control over logging.
 * Persistent background jobs are now supported though an application hook
 * The API has been updated to be more user friendly, and it makes it easier
   to create divide-and-conquer/mapreduce applications (breaks the code of
   previous versions)
 * A .properties file now may be used to set property values and
   finetune application.
 * The javadocs have been completed
 * Various bug fixes
